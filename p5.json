The 2nd\nand 3rd dimension can also be interpreted as time.<br /><br />The actual\nnoise is structured similar to an audio signal, in respect to the\nfunction&#39;s use of frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics in\nphysics, perlin noise is computed over several octaves which are added\ntogether for the final result. <br /><br />Another way to adjust the\ncharacter of the resulting sequence is the scale of the input\ncoordinates.
